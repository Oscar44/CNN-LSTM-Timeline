Real estate market situation prediction

Due to crisis of COVID-19 all the cities around the world have reported a huge impact in a lot of aspects but what is happening in the real state market? Banks do not understand of crisis and want to keep mortgages' payments up to date. One of the most relevant indicators (at least in Spain) about the situation is the real state pricing trend. Based on intuition, seems to be reasonable believing that in this critical situation the real state market should change the trend or at least should show some changes based on it.

Let's analyse the consequences of COVID-19 in the real state market in Barcelona.
